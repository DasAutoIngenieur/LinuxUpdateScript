# LinuxUpdateScript(Debian)

Just a Simple update and upgrade script for debian that checks for a network connection and updates and upgrades the system
You can put it in your ftp server, host simplepythonhttpserver and curl/wget it or any way of file transfering
I made this cause I don't want to manually type it out when I have a docker image, virtual machine, etc
